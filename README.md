Styling for Sanseer Journals

With respect to FairStrides Custom Journal on which it is based:

[FVTT-Custom-Journal-Theming](https://github.com/Fair-Strides/FVTT-Custom-Journal-Theming).

Like any GM, I like to give my players as rich an experience as I can - the reason I am making the move to Foundry. I have many references / journals in game and I wanted those journals to align with my own game aesthetic. That, in itself, aligns with Foundry's own game UI and so I have created a theme and some templates that match that.

There are still a number of things that require done to refine and polish it all.

It is primarily for my own personal use.
